# Loxdown

Loxdown is an experimental statically-typed variant of the Lox programming language, written during the [COVID-19 lockdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic).  It was originally implemented by following the exellent book ["Crafting Interpreters" by Bob Nystrom](https://www.craftinginterpreters.com/). The static type system was added later, so the core of the implementation is still a dynamically-typed tree-walking interpreter.

This is not really intented for other people to use. It was mainly an exercise to learn more about implementing languages and type systems.
